				<h4>
					What is Quantum Field Theory?
				</h4>
				<p>
					As the name suggests, it is a <i>theory</i> that attempts to explain the world of <i>quantum</i> physics using mathematical objects called <i>fields</i>.
					<ul>
						<li> Theory - A set of ideas that are tested for robustness against experimental observations. You cannot prove a theory to be correct, you can only prove a theory to not be wrong by passing all the tests! </li>
						<li> Quantum - A discrete entity (not continuous) in the language of mathematics.
							For example, the electronic configuration of atoms are described with <i>discretely</i>-spaced energy levels.
							An electron jumps from one energy level to another by releasing or absorbing a <i>fixed</i> amount of energy.
							The discrete values of these energy levels are determined by solving quantum mechanical equations in three dimensions,
							see <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/SphericalHarmonic.html">spherical harmonics</a> for more details.
							<i>There is a misconception that quantum refers to the "small" world, but it actually refers to the "discrete" world.</i> </li>
						<li> Fields - A field is a mathematical object that represents a fundamental or composite particle. A field is defined by its symmetries, i.e. which mathematical operations return the object to its original state (this is called <i>invariance</i>). </li>
					</ul>
