				I am an enthusiastic programmer with an academic background in Theoretical Particle Physics and industry experience in the IT sector. My existence in this world began a couple of months after the reunification of East and West Germany in 1990. I was born on the same day that Poundland opened its first store, 13th December.
				I currently reside in the lovely coastal city of Brighton with my partner, whom I met at Sussex University.

			<h4>
				Academic background
			</h4>
			<p>
				I began my higher education studies at Royal Holloway, Univeristy of London in September 2009. The course I underook was an MSci Physics, also known as an "Integrated Masters" (first 2.5 years on a Bachelors programme and last 1.5 years on a Masters programme). During this time I picked up a real passion for wanting to understand the structure of the world in every aspect.
				Fortunately, I succeeded in obtaining a First Class Honours degree and found a position as a PhD student in Theoretical Particle Physics at the Universtiy of Sussex. My PhD goal was to investigate the theoretical conditions underlying a cosmological event in the early universe, whereby all the Standard Model particles obtain a non-zero rest mass. This event is the Electroweak Phase Transition, which embodies the famous Higgs Mechanism.

				IT industry background

				Following immediately after the completion of my doctoral degree I landed a job in industry with a mid-sized company in Theale called Automation Consultants. During my role as a Technical IT Consultant I experienced a deep-end-dive into the world of IT systems, software development, software testing, DevOps, and office work.
