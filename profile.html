				I am an enthusiastic programmer with an academic background in Theoretical Particle Physics and industry experience in the IT sector.
				My existence in this world began a couple of months after the reunification of East and West Germany in 1990.
				I was born on the same day that Poundland opened its first store, 13th December.
				I currently reside in the lovely coastal city of Brighton with my partner, whom I met at Sussex University.

			<h4>
				Academic background
			</h4>
			<p>
				I began my higher education studies at Royal Holloway, University of London in September 2009.
				The course I underook was an MSci Physics, also known as an "Integrated Masters" (first 2.5 years on a Bachelors programme and last 1.5 years on a Masters programme).
				During this time I picked up a real passion for wanting to understand the structure of the world in every aspect.
				Fortunately, I succeeded in obtaining a First Class Honours degree and found a position as a PhD student in Theoretical Particle Physics at the Universtiy of Sussex.
			</p>
			<p class="new">
				My PhD goal was to investigate the theoretical conditions underlying a cosmological event in the early universe, whereby all the Standard Model particles obtain a non-zero rest mass.
				This event is the Electroweak Phase Transition, which embodies the famous Higgs Mechanism.
				My doctoral studies resulted in a <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FJHEP06%282016%29005">publication</a> that discovered a link between a zero temperature quantity of any model and the strength of the phase transition.

			<h4>
				IT industry background
			</h4>
			<p>
				Following immediately after the completion of my doctoral degree I landed a job in industry with a mid-sized company in Theale, Reading called Automation Consultants Ltd.
				During my role as a Technical Consultant, I experienced a deep-end-dive into the world of IT systems, software testing, software development, DevOps, and on-site & in-office work.
			</p>
			<p class="new">
				My time in this company was roughly split into a 67% client-facing role and 33% internal researcher role.
				Client facing work included performance testing, automation scripting, and software development.
				The researcher role primarily focused on understanding Deep Learning applications in the market and self-learning how to implement Neural Networks using Python's TensorFlow framework.
